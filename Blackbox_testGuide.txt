PART2: Based on the E-Shop Application Modules for Black Box Functional Testing listed above. For each module in my project, please generate test cases following this framework, with particular focus on validating all input fields, checking boundary conditions, and ensuring business rules are properly enforced. 
The number of test cases should be around 7-12 test cases for a UI (depending on the core functionalities in that UI) and write the test case description detailedly (the way the user interacts to test it), should be mostly GUI test cases, a few general functionality test cases and 1 edge case.
1. Test Case Overview:
   - Test Case ID: Unique identifier for each test case (e.g., FT_001, FT_002)
   - Test Purpose: Clear description of what is being tested
   - Test Steps: Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Expected Results: Precise description of what should happen
   - Prerequisites: Any preconditions needed before executing the test

2. GUI/Interface Testing:
   - Layout verification: Check positioning, alignment, font consistency, and spacing
   - Responsive design: Ensure interface works properly with Ctrl- and Ctrl+ commands
   - Tab order: Verify logical tab order (left to right, top to bottom) and reverse with Shift+Tab
   - Default focus: Confirm cursor position on initial field that can be edited
   - Enter key behavior: Test functionality when pressing Enter on different elements
   - Button state consistency: Verify enabled/disabled states are appropriate
   - Spelling and grammar: Check all text for errors
   - Label consistency: Ensure terminology is consistent across screens

3. Functional Testing:
   - Form validation:
     * Required fields validation with * marking
     * Text/string data validation (max length, case sensitivity, special characters, null handling)
     * Numeric data validation (max length, boundary values, special character handling)
     * Date/time validation (format, range, selection methods)
     * File upload validation (size limits, format restrictions)
   - Error messaging:
     * Consistent error message style
     * User-friendly language with suggestions to resolve
     * Appropriate validation for boundary conditions
   - CRUD operations:
     * Create: Verify successful creation with proper validation and database storage
     * Read: Confirm accurate display of database information
     * Update: Test modification with validation and database update verification
     * Delete: Ensure confirmation prompt and proper database handling

4. Business Logic Testing:
   - Workflow validation: Test all business rules and scenario paths
   - Edge cases: Identify and test boundary conditions
   - Process optimization: Evaluate number of steps for key tasks
   - Usability: Assess ease of understanding and use
   - Flexibility: Evaluate ability to modify/extend functionality
